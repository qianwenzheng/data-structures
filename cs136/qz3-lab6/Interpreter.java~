 * This class is designed to read input and perform math operators in PostScript. 
 *
 * Problems:
 * 10.3: In order to fill a stack with a copy of another while maintaining the order of the elements, you would do this by creating 
 * another stack in addition to the stack you wish to fill. You would pop each element from the original stack, and then push it into 
 * the additional stack you created. When you are finished popping all the elements from the original stack until it is empty and pushing
 * them into the additional stack, you will them begin to fill the stack you wanted to fill. You will do this by popping the elements 
 * from the additional stack you created. Each element popped from the additional stack will be pushed into the stack you wish to fill
 * until the additional stack is empty. This will maintain the order of the elements in the original stack. You need an additional stack
 * because stacks follow the LIFO (Last in, first out) principle, so the last element entered in the original stack would be the first
 * entered in the additional stack, reversing the order. In order to maintain the order, putting the elements from the additional stack
 * into the one you want to fill restores the original order. This would leave the original copy empty, but if you wish to preserve the
 * elements inside it then you could first make a temporary copy from the original stack, thus manipulating the temporary copy instead
 * of the original stack.  
 * 
 * 10.4: If you wish to reverse the order of elements of a stack, you would want to create two additional stacks. You would pop the 
 * elements from the original stack and push them into the first additional stack one at a time. When that is done and the original
 * stack is empty, the first additional stack would have the elements in reverse order. You would create another additional stack and
 * pop the elements from the first additional stack and push them into the second additional stack. When this is done and the first 
 * additional stack is empty, the elements in the second stack would be in the original order. You would then pop the elements from this
 * second additional stack and push them into the empty original stack. When this is done, the elements in the original stack would be 
 * in reverse order. 
 * 
 * 10.5: If you wish to copy a queue into another, assuming that you can only use queue operations and no iterators, you would need to
 * first make a temporary queue that is equal to the original queue so that you do not have to modify the original. Since queues follow
 * the FIFO (first in first out) principle, you would use dequeue to remove the element at the head of the temp. queue, and use enqueue
 * to add it to the queue you wish to fill. You would do this for every element until the temp. queue is empty. The queue you filled 
 * would have the elements in the original order.
